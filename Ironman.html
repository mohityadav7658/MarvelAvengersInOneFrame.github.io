                <p align="left">Iron Man: Armored Adventures (also known in early promotional materials
                    as Iron Man: The
                    Animated Series) is a 3D CGI-animated series based on the Marvel Comics superhero
                    Iron Man. It
                    debuted in the United States on Nicktoons on April 24, 2009, and it aired on
                    Teletoon in Canada.[3]
                    The series is story edited by showrunner Christopher Yost,[4] who also worked on
                    Wolverine and the
                    X-Men, and numerous other Marvel Animation projects. The television show is not
                    related to the 2007
                    animated film The Invincible Iron Man; it has a different voice cast, but some story
                    elements are
                    similar and the show uses the same musical score as the film in some instances. It
                    is the first Iron
                    Man television series since Iron Man from 1994 to 1996, and started airing after the
                    success of the
                    live action Iron Man film. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IRON MAN THEN CLICK ON
